# Current Frontend State & Testing Plan

## Step 5 - Testing the Connection

We can test each feature:

### Create an Agent
- Visit http://localhost:3000/create
- Enter a valid Telegram channel link and expert name
- Submit and verify redirection to chat

### Chat with Agent
- After creating an agent, you'll be redirected to /chat/[agentId]
- Send messages and verify responses
- Test error handling

### Search
- Visit http://localhost:3000/search
- Enter search queries
- Verify results display

### Agent Listing
- Visit http://localhost:3000/agents
- Verify list of created agents
- Test chat links

## Backend Issues Found

Looking at the backend logs, several issues need to be addressed:

1. UUID format error in agent list endpoint
   - Error: invalid input syntax for type uuid: "list"
   - This suggests a type mismatch in the agent ID handling

2. 404 Not Found on search endpoint
   - The search endpoint appears to be missing or incorrectly configured
   - Need to verify route implementation

3. 422 Unprocessable Entity on agent creation
   - Validation errors in the request payload
   - Need to check request format and validation rules

These backend issues should be fixed before proceeding with frontend integration testing.
