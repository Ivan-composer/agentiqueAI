# This Procfile is optimized for high concurrency scenarios.
# It uses gunicorn with multiple uvicorn workers to handle concurrent requests.
# To use this configuration:
# 1. Rename this file to 'Procfile'
# 2. Deploy to Railway
# Note: The number of workers (4) can be adjusted based on available resources.
