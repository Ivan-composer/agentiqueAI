Below is a **step-by-step** instruction set for **Cursor** (or any dev) to implement **file-based logging** in the Agentique backend. This ensures you can see logs—even if you don’t have access to the terminal that launched the server—by simply opening or tailing a log file.

# Logging Solution (Step-by-Step)

### **Step 1: Create a Utility File for Logging**

1. **Navigate** to `app/utils/` (create the folder if it doesn’t exist).  
2. **Create** a file named `logger.py` with minimal code:

   ```python
   """
   logger.py: Minimal logging setup writing to logs/server.log so we can review logs easily.
   """

   import logging
   import os
   from logging.handlers import RotatingFileHandler

   # Ensure we have a logs directory
   os.makedirs("logs", exist_ok=True)

   # Create a logger
   logger = logging.getLogger("agentique")
   logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)  # or INFO if you prefer less verbosity

   # File handler to rotate logs if the file grows too large
   file_handler = RotatingFileHandler(
       "logs/server.log",
       maxBytes=5_000_000,  # e.g., 5 MB
       backupCount=3        # keep up to 3 old log files
   )
   file_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

   # Simple log format
   formatter = logging.Formatter(
       "%(asctime)s [%(levelname)s] %(name)s: %(message)s"
   )
   file_handler.setFormatter(formatter)

   # Attach the handler to our logger
   logger.addHandler(file_handler)
   ```

   **Why**:
   - We keep code lines minimal but ensure logs rotate (so logs/server.log doesn’t bloat).
   - `logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)` ensures all messages are captured.

### **Step 2: Use This Logger in Your Routes/Services**

1. **Import** the logger wherever you need logs:
   ```python
   from app.utils.logger import logger
   ```
2. **Add** logging calls:
   ```python
   @router.post("/create")
   def create_agent(...):
       logger.info("Creating agent with channel_link=%s", channel_link)
       ...
   ```
   - Keep the **logic** minimal, but ensure docstrings & comments if needed.

### **Step 3: View Logs Without Terminal Access**

Once the server is running (e.g., `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`):

1. **Open or Tail** the file `logs/server.log`:
   - e.g. “Cursor, open `logs/server.log`” or “Cursor, show me the last 50 lines of `logs/server.log`.”  
   - You’ll see lines like:
     ```
     2023-09-20 12:34:56 [INFO] agentique: Creating agent with channel_link=t.me/samplechannel
     ```
2. **Check** for error lines (`[ERROR]`, `[CRITICAL]`) if something fails.

### **Step 4: Optional Enhancements**

1. **Change** `maxBytes` or `backupCount` if you want bigger or smaller logs.  
2. **Switch** to `logging.INFO` or `logging.WARNING` if you want less verbosity.

### **Step 5: Additional Production Considerations**

- In a **production** environment (like Railway), you can still write to logs/server.log, but you might also rely on console logs for the platform’s logging system. For local dev or if you want a dedicated file, this solution suffices.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, **Cursor** can implement a rotating file-based logger in **Agentique** with minimal code overhead. Any logs that appear in the console are also captured in `logs/server.log`. Then you can open or tail that file in Cursor—seeing every info, warning, or error message without having to rely on the original terminal output.
